# 🧞‍♂️ Djinni: Number Guessing Game

> A dramatic console-based guessing game where the computer tries to read your mind... and judges you if you lie.

---

## 🎮 What is this?

This is a Python-based number guessing game with a twist:  
**You think of a number — the computer tries to guess it.**  
But this is no ordinary machine...  
This is **Djinni** — proud, sassy, clever, and emotional 🤖✨

## 🧠 Game Mechanics

- You pick a number between **1 and 100**
- Djinni will guess your number using **binary search**
- You must honestly answer:
  - ❓ *"Is it your number?"*
  - ❓ *"Is it bigger than..."*
- You choose the **difficulty level**:
  - 🟢 Easy – 5 attempts
  - 🟡 Medium – 6 attempts
  - 🔴 Hard – 7 attempts *(you can't win... unless you lie)*

## 💥 Endings (6+!)

Depending on your choices, you'll reach one of several endings:

1. ❌ You refuse to be honest — Djinni walks away
2. ❌ You're not ready — Djinni leaves disappointed
3. ❗ Djinni guesses right, but you lie — dramatic rage
4. ❗ You misclick and agree on the wrong number — mockery
5. ✅ Djinni wins in a fair game — smug glory
6. ✅ You outplay Djinni — rare and noble victory
